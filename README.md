## Project Description
This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict sales based on various features such as past sales data, seasonality, product categories, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can assist in decision-making for businesses.

Key features include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training using popular algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- Performance evaluation and optimization
- Predictive analytics to forecast sales

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for building the model and data processing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for experimentation and analysis

## Installation Instructions
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git
   cd sales-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the data file is in place (check the data folder) and the model script is ready to run.

## Usage
Once everything is set up, you can run the project by executing the script:

```bash
python sales_prediction_model.py
```

Alternatively, if you are using a Jupyter Notebook, open the `Sales_Prediction.ipynb` file and run the cells in sequence.

### Example
```python
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/sales_data.csv')

# Train the model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
